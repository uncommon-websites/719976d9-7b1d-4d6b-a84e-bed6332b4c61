		"Product managers at fast-growing consumer brands face an impossible choice: wait weeks for traditional market research that costs thousands, or make critical product decisions based on gut feeling while competitors surge ahead. We witnessed brilliant teams with game-changing ideas held back by outdated research methods that couldn't keep pace with modern product development cycles.",
		"That's why we built &facts to analyze billions of real-world consumer behavior signals and deliver instant market validation in minutes, not months. Instead of relying on what people say they'll do in surveys, we capture what they're actually doing across social platforms, search engines, and shopping behaviors to give product teams the reliable data they need to move fast with confidence.",
		"Today, &facts is transforming how consumer brands validate new concepts, helping teams run 10,000+ validation reports monthly and make data-backed decisions at the speed of business. We're not just changing market researchâ€”we're enabling a new era where the best ideas win because teams can test, learn, and iterate faster than ever before."
